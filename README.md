# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms
## Introduction:
In this article, we will see all the available algorithms in computer programming. This will be helpful to develop and build great products and thus will improve efficiency and quality.
## Description:
I have listed out all the algorithms at one place. Few of them are most familiar one's and the rest all of them are not used by us on a regular basis. However, these concepts/data structures/algorithms are really helpful when deciding the complexity of the architecture or problem. If all of us make use of these algorithms at right place, we can build and deliver top-notch products to the market.

## Understanding Big O Notation:
One of the key concepts that emerges is Big O notation. Big O notation is a mathematical representation used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm, specifically its time complexity and space complexity. It provides a high-level understanding of how the performance of an algorithm changes as the size of the input data grows.

The significance of Big O notation lies in its ability to help developers compare the efficiency of different algorithms regardless of hardware or implementation specifics. This abstraction allows you to focus on the algorithm's inherent efficiency rather than the details of the programming language or machine architecture.

**So, why is a logarithm used when measuring complexity, and what does it tell us about an algorithm’s efficiency**?

Logarithms show up in complexity because they represent repeated halving (or dividing) of a problem. When an algorithm uses a strategy like “divide and conquer,” it breaks a large problem into smaller parts with each step. The number of steps it takes to solve the problem grows slowly compared to the size of the input. So, if you double the input size, you only need one more step to finish.

Imagine a phone book with thousands of names in alphabetical order. If you’re looking for one specific name, instead of starting from the beginning and searching each name, you could open the book near the middle. From there, if the name you want is in the first half, you ignore the second half entirely. Each time you check, you only need to look at half the remaining list.

This type of searching is known as **binary search**, and it’s an example of an O(log n) algorithm.

When an algorithm has logarithmic complexity (O(log n)), it means it’s very efficient for large inputs because it only needs a few extra steps as the input size increases. In practical terms, this tells us that algorithms like binary search are great for large data sets, as they require far fewer steps to complete than an O(n) (linear) or O(n²) (quadratic) algorithm would.
