# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms
## Introduction:
In this article, we will see all the available algorithms in computer programming. This will be helpful to develop and build great products and thus will improve efficiency and quality.
## Description:
I have listed out all the algorithms at one place. Few of them are most familiar one's and the rest all of them are not used by us on a regular basis. However, these concepts/data structures/algorithms are really helpful when deciding the complexity of the architecture or problem. If all of us make use of these algorithms at right place, we can build and deliverÂ top-notch products to the market.

## Understanding Big O Notation:
One of the key concepts that emerges is Big O notation. Big O notation is a mathematical representation used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm, specifically its time complexity and space complexity. It provides a high-level understanding of how the performance of an algorithm changes as the size of the input data grows.

The significance of Big O notation lies in its ability to help developers compare the efficiency of different algorithms regardless of hardware or implementation specifics. This abstraction allows you to focus on the algorithm's inherent efficiency rather than the details of the programming language or machine architecture.
